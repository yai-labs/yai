# ADR Index

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture irreversible or high-impact technical choices.

An ADR should answer:
- what was decided,
- why alternatives were rejected,
- what consequences are accepted,
- which law/spec anchors govern the decision.

## Canonical ADR set

- `ADR-001-single-runtime.md`
- `ADR-002-root-entrypoint.md`
- `ADR-003-kernel-authority.md`
- `ADR-004-engine-execution.md`
- `ADR-005-mind-proposer.md`
- `ADR-006-unified-rpc.md`
- `ADR-007-workspace-isolation.md`
- `ADR-008-connection-lifecycle.md`
- `ADR-009-engine-attachment.md`
- `ADR-010-boot-entrypoint.md`
- `ADR-011-contract-baseline-lock.md`

## Template policy

The ADR template is canonical only in:
- `docs/templates/adr/ADR-000-template.md`

No template copy should be kept inside this ADR directory.

## Maintenance notes

When adding a new ADR:
- update this index,
- ensure law/spec references are explicit,
- add downstream runbook linkage when available.
