# Benchmarks

This space is for governance-effect benchmarks, not generic LLM quality benchmarks.

Purpose:
- quantify containment and governance overhead
- compare profiles/runs under controlled conditions
- preserve reproducible format for SC102 and future scenarios

Not blocking SC102 execution: this is scaffolding + format now.
