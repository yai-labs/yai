# Documentation Map (Docs IA v1 Overlay)

This is the non-breaking docs overlay for YAI.

Policy:
- Existing paths remain valid.
- No legacy folder moves are required in this phase.
- New artifacts should be placed in the layered hubs below.

## Start Here (Layered Hubs)

- Platform: `docs/10-platform/`
- Governance: `docs/20-governance/`
- Program: `docs/30-program/`
- Catalog: `docs/40-catalog/`
- Qualification: `docs/50-qualification/`
- Validation: `docs/60-validation/`
- Guides: `docs/70-guides/`

## Legacy Paths (Still Canonical and Supported)

- Architecture: `docs/architecture/`
- Policy: `docs/_policy/`
- Design: `docs/design/`
- Runbooks: `docs/runbooks/`
- Milestone packs: `docs/milestone-packs/`

- Proof: `docs/proof/`
- Templates: `docs/templates/`
- Dev guide: `docs/dev-guide/`
- Getting started: `docs/getting-started/`
- User guide: `docs/user-guide/`

## Core Program Links

- Execution plan: `docs/program-delivery/audit-convergence/EXECUTION-PLAN-v0.1.0.md`
- Convergence matrix: `docs/program-delivery/audit-convergence/AUDIT-CONVERGENCE-MATRIX-v0.1.0.md`

## Usage Model

- Catalog (`40-catalog`) defines target capabilities and scenario specs.

- Qualification (`50-qualification`) defines executable gates and evidence runs.
- Validation (`60-validation`) carries audits and proof-verification outputs.
