# Documentation Map (Docs IA v1)

This repository now uses a hard-cut layered documentation structure.
Legacy internal path aliases are removed.

## Start Here (Layered Hubs)

- Platform: `docs/10-platform/`
- Governance: `docs/20-program/`
- Program: `docs/20-program/`
- Catalog: `docs/40-catalog/`
- Qualification: `docs/50-qualification/`
- Validation: `docs/60-validation/`
- Guides: `docs/70-guides/`

## Canonical Anchors

- Architecture: `docs/10-platform/architecture/`
- Governance spine: `docs/20-program/spine.md`
- Governance traceability: `docs/20-program/traceability.md`
- Runbooks: `docs/20-program/23-runbooks/`
- Milestone packs: `docs/20-program/24-milestone-packs/`
- Program convergence: `docs/20-program/audit-convergence/`
