# Documentation (Runtime-First)

`yai` keeps runtime implementation and build-oriented documentation only.

Governance, program delivery, templates, qualification packs, audits, and proof artifacts
are canonical in `yai-infra`.

Canonical references:
- `../yai-infra/docs/governance/yai/`
- `../yai-infra/docs/governance/`
- `../yai-infra/migration/`

For API/architecture browsing in this repo, use generated Doxygen (`make docs`).
