# Documentation Map (Docs IA v1 Overlay)

This is the non-breaking docs overlay for YAI.

Policy:
- Existing paths remain valid.
- No legacy folder moves are required in this phase.
- New artifacts should be placed in the layered hubs below.

- Catalog: `docs/40-catalog/`
- Qualification: `docs/50-qualification/`
- Validation: `docs/60-validation/`
- Guides: `docs/70-guides/`

## Legacy Paths (Still Canonical and Supported)

- Architecture: `docs/10-platform/architecture/`
- Policy: `docs/20-governance/policies/_policy/`
- Design: `docs/20-governance/design/`
- Runbooks: `docs/20-governance/runbooks/`
- Milestone packs: `docs/20-governance/milestone-packs/`

- Runbooks (`20-governance/runbooks` -> `docs/20-governance/runbooks`) define implementation work.
- Qualification (`50-qualification`) defines executable gates and evidence runs.
- Validation (`60-validation`) carries audits and proof-verification outputs.
