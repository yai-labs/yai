# 50 Qualification

Executable qualification program.

Purpose:
- Convert catalog scenarios into deterministic test gates with repeatable evidence.

Gate directories:
- `docs/50-qualification/QT-0.1-001-SC102/`
- `docs/50-qualification/QT-0.1-002-SC103/`

Rule:
- Qualification artifacts define execution and evidence.
- Audits/proof validation remain under `docs/60-validation/`.
