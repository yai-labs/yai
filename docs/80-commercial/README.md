# Commercial Track

This section contains customer-facing commercialization strategy for YAI.

## Canonical documents

- `COMMERCIAL-PLAN-v1.0.md` - formal commercial strategy, packaging, GTM, and operating model.
- `EXECUTIVE-BRIEF-v1.0.md` - short C-level narrative for first conversations.
- `PILOT-OFFER-v1.0.md` - 14-day pilot structure, deliverables, and success criteria.
- `ROI-MODEL-v1.0.md` - ROI framework tied to wave evidence and measured outcomes.

## Positioning anchor

YAI is positioned as AI runtime governance infrastructure:

- not a model provider
- not only observability
- not policy documentation alone

YAI enforces runtime controls with evidence that can be replayed and verified.

## Traceability

Commercial claims must map to:

- scenario: `docs/30-catalog/scenarios/SC-102.md`
- execution: `docs/40-qualification/QT-0.1-003-SC102-WAVE1/`
- proof: `docs/40-qualification/WAVES/<wave_id>/`
