# Agent Playbook

Execution sequence for docs/governance work:

1. Read target runbook/ADR/phase scope.
2. Apply deterministic file-system changes.
3. Rewrite stale links and path contracts.
4. Run validation commands.
5. Attach evidence and summarize residual risks.

Use this playbook for phased docs delivery and audit convergence tasks.
