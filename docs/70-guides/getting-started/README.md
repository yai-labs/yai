# Getting Started

This section is the onboarding lane for contributors who need a fast but correct understanding of the repo docs system.

## First session path

1. `docs/README.md`
2. `docs/design/spine.md`
3. `docs/architecture/specs-bridge.md`
4. `docs/dev-guide/repo-workflow.md`
5. `docs/dev-guide/repo-tooling.md`

## What you should understand after this path

- where normative truth lives,
- where decisions are recorded,
- how execution is documented,
- how evidence is expected and reviewed.

## Contribution hint

If onboarding friction appears repeatedly, add focused material here and link it from this index.
