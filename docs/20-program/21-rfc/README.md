# RFC Series (Canonical)

This directory is the canonical home for governance RFCs migrated from legacy PRP proposals.

## Mapping PRP -> RFC

| Legacy PRP | Canonical RFC | Status |
|---|---|---|
| PRP-001 | RFC-001-runtime-topology-and-authority.md | draft |
| PRP-002 | RFC-002-unified-rpc-and-cli-contract.md | draft |
| PRP-003 | RFC-003-workspace-lifecycle-and-isolation.md | draft |
| PRP-004 | RFC-004-contract-baseline-lock-and-pin-policy.md | draft |
| PRP-005 | RFC-005-formal-coverage-roadmap.md | draft |

## Rules

- RFC numbering is preserved from PRP numbering (001..005).
- Legacy PRP paths are kept as pointer documents under `docs/20-program/21-proposals/`.
- New proposal work should start directly as RFC.
