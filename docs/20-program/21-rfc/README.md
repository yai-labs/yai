# RFC Series (Canonical)

This directory is the canonical home for governance RFCs migrated from legacy PRP proposals.

## Mapping PRP -> RFC

| Legacy PRP | Canonical RFC | Linked ADR | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| PRP-001 | `RFC-001-runtime-topology-and-authority.md` | `docs/20-program/22-adr/ADR-001-single-runtime.md` | draft |
| PRP-002 | `RFC-002-unified-rpc-and-cli-contract.md` | `docs/20-program/22-adr/ADR-006-unified-rpc.md` | draft |
| PRP-003 | `RFC-003-workspace-lifecycle-and-isolation.md` | `docs/20-program/22-adr/ADR-007-workspace-isolation.md` | draft |
| PRP-004 | `RFC-004-contract-baseline-lock-and-pin-policy.md` | `docs/20-program/22-adr/ADR-011-contract-baseline-lock.md` | draft |
| PRP-005 | `RFC-005-formal-coverage-roadmap.md` | `docs/20-program/22-adr/ADR-012-audit-convergence-gates.md` | draft |

## Rules

- RFC numbering is preserved from PRP numbering (001..005).
- PRP IDs are retained only as historical mapping metadata.
- New proposal work should start directly as RFC.
