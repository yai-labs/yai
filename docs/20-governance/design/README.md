# Design

This directory hosts design-level artifacts that transform ideas into executable delivery.

It contains:
- exploration documents (proposals),
- frozen decisions (ADRs),
- traceability/navigation support.

## Structure

- ADRs: `docs/design/adr/`
- Proposals: `docs/design/proposals/`
- Spine: `docs/design/spine.md`
- Traceability map: `docs/design/traceability.md`

## Templates

- ADR template: `docs/templates/adr/ADR-000-template.md`
- Proposal template: `docs/templates/proposals/PRP-000-template.md`

## Practical workflow

1. Explore with a proposal if decision is still open.
2. Freeze chosen direction in an ADR.
3. Convert ADR intent into phased runbook execution.
4. Close phases via milestone packs with evidence.

## Design quality rule

Every design artifact should be traceable:
- upstream to normative anchors,
- downstream to runbook execution and evidence.
