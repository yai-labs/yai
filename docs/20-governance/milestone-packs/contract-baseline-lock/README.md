# Contract Baseline Lock Milestone Packs

This is the foundational MP track for ADR-011.

Runbook reference:
- `docs/runbooks/contract-baseline-lock.md`

Planned sequence:
- `docs/milestone-packs/contract-baseline-lock/MP-CONTRACT-BASELINE-LOCK-0.1.0.md`
- `docs/milestone-packs/contract-baseline-lock/MP-CONTRACT-BASELINE-LOCK-0.1.1.md`
- `docs/milestone-packs/contract-baseline-lock/MP-CONTRACT-BASELINE-LOCK-0.1.2.md`
- `docs/milestone-packs/contract-baseline-lock/MP-CONTRACT-BASELINE-LOCK-0.1.3.md`
- `docs/milestone-packs/contract-baseline-lock/MP-CONTRACT-BASELINE-LOCK-0.1.4.md`

Notes:
- Create each MP only when the corresponding runbook phase is delivered.
- Keep cross-repo evidence pointers explicit (`yai-specs`, `yai`, `yai-cli`).
