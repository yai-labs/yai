# Scenarios Index

Scenario specs define qualification targets and invariants.

Current scenarios:
- `SC-102.md` core contain-to-evidence gate (cross-domain, no mind).
- `SC-103-mind-integrated-remediation.md` advanced gate with cognition/agentic surfaces.

Rules:
- Scenarios define expected behavior, not implementation procedures.
- Runtime implementation sequencing belongs to runbooks under `docs/20-governance/23-runbooks/`.
