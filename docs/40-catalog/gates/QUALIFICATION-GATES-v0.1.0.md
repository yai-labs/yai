# Qualification Gates v0.1.0

This index maps official qualification gates to catalog scenarios.

Gate list:
- `QT-0.1-001-SC102` -> `docs/50-qualification/QT-0.1-001-SC102/`
- `QT-0.1-002-SC103` -> `docs/50-qualification/QT-0.1-002-SC103/`

Policy:
- Each gate must define deterministic pass/fail criteria.
- Each gate must include reproducible command evidence and run artifacts.
