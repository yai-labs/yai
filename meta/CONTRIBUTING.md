# Contributing to ICE Foundation

## Purpose of This Repository

ICE Foundation is a **normative repository**.

It defines:
- axioms
- structural invariants
- conceptual boundaries

It does **not** implement systems, features, or behavior.

Contributions are accepted **only** if they improve the clarity,
correctness, or coherence of the foundational material.

---

## What “Contributing” Means Here

Contributing to ICE Foundation means:

- Clarifying existing axioms, invariants, or boundaries
- Correcting inconsistencies, ambiguities, or imprecision
- Improving formal rigor or conceptual alignment
- Proposing well-justified refinements to foundational definitions
- Raising valid objections when material contradicts itself

Contributions are **conceptual**, not operational.

---

## What Is NOT a Valid Contribution

The following are **out of scope** and will be closed without discussion:

- Feature requests
- Implementation ideas or code
- Runtime, engine, or AI design proposals
- Tooling, APIs, or architecture diagrams
- Performance, scaling, or optimization topics
- Opinions not grounded in the existing axiomatic framework
- “What if” explorations without formal justification

If a topic requires execution semantics,
it does not belong in ICE Foundation.

---

## Contribution Paths

### 1. Discussions (Preferred Entry Point)

Use **Discussions** for:
- Clarification questions
- Conceptual challenges
- Requests for explanation
- Boundary interpretation

Discussions are the correct place to test understanding
before proposing changes.

---

### 2. Issues

Open an **Issue** only when:

- You identify a contradiction or inconsistency
- A definition is ambiguous or incomplete
- A document violates established boundaries
- A foundational assumption requires formal challenge

Issues must be **precise and scoped**.

Vague or speculative issues will be closed.

---

### 3. Pull Requests

Pull Requests are accepted only if they:

- Modify existing axioms, invariants, boundaries, or terminology
- Improve clarity without changing meaning, **or**
- Propose a change with explicit axiomatic justification

Every PR must:

- Reference the relevant axiom(s) or invariant(s)
- Explain *why* the change preserves or improves system validity
- Avoid introducing new operational semantics

PRs that introduce behavior, mechanisms, or implementation logic
will be rejected.

---

## Authority and Review

ICE Foundation is **not consensus-driven**.

Final authority rests with the maintainers,
who are responsible for preserving:

- conceptual integrity
- long-term coherence
- non-negotiable constraints

Rejection of a contribution is not a judgment of intent,
but of **fit with the Foundation’s role**.

---

## Language and Terminology

All contributions must:

- Use controlled vocabulary as defined in `terminology/`
- Respect the canonical knowledge hierarchy
- Avoid metaphorical or overloaded language

If terminology is ambiguous, the contribution is invalid.

---

## Code of Conduct

All participation is governed by the
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

ICE Foundation prioritizes:
- professional conduct
- technical rigor
- respect for scope and authority

---

## Final Note

ICE Foundation evolves **slowly and deliberately**.

That is intentional.

If your contribution requires speed, iteration,
or experimentation, it likely belongs
in a downstream ICE repository — not here.
