# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the context of **ICE Foundation**, participation refers to discussion,
review, critique, and clarification of foundational concepts.

We, as maintainers and participants, pledge to keep all interactions
professional, respectful, and focused on the **conceptual integrity**
of the project.

ICE Foundation is a **normative and axiomatic repository**.
It exists to define constraints, not opinions.

Participation is expected to reflect this purpose.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a constructive environment include:

- Maintaining a professional and technically rigorous tone
- Engaging in good-faith discussion of ideas, not individuals
- Respecting conceptual boundaries and repository scope
- Accepting correction when statements contradict canonical material
- Keeping discussions focused on clarity, validity, and coherence

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Personal attacks, insults, or derogatory remarks
- Trolling, bad-faith argumentation, or deliberate derailment
- Repeatedly ignoring established axioms, invariants, or boundaries
- Introducing ideological, political, or personal agendas
- Harassment, intimidation, or hostile behavior in any form

ICE Foundation is not a debate arena.
It is a **source of structural truth**.
