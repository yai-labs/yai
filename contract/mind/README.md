# YAI Mind Contract (private mirror)

This directory is the internal compatibility layer for:
- protocol IDs
- handshake schema
- roles/arming semantics
- error codes
- transport envelope expectations

Source-of-truth today: this repo.
Future plan: periodically align with yai-specs (public) and bump protocol version.
