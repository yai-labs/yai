# Boundary: Foundation ↔ Consciousness

## Purpose

Define and formalize the **conceptual boundary** between the **ICE Foundation**
and the **Consciousness** domain.

This document establishes that **continuity, memory, experience, and historical
reasoning** do not possess foundational authority and must never redefine
axioms, invariants, or conceptual validity.

The goal is to prevent **cognitive continuity** from collapsing into
**conceptual truth**.

---

## Foundational Position

The ICE Foundation is **a-temporal** and **non-cognitive**.

It defines:

- Axioms that establish what is assumed to be true
- Structural invariants that constrain validity over time
- Conditions for traceability, authority, and determinism

The Foundation does **not** experience time.

The Foundation does **not** remember.

---

## Role of the Foundation

The ICE Foundation:

- Defines **truth conditions** independent of history
- Establishes **what may be attributed and explained**
- Constrains how historical reasoning may be interpreted
- Determines validity boundaries for long-term reasoning

The Foundation defines **meaning**, not experience.

---

## Role of Consciousness

The Consciousness domain:

- Maintains **long-term memory** and persistence across time
- Preserves decision context and causal continuity
- Aggregates traces into durable cognitive representations
- Supports retrospective reasoning and explanation
- Enables understanding of *how a system arrived at its state*

Consciousness answers **why things unfolded over time**,  
never **what is valid by definition**.

---

## Explicit Non-Responsibilities of the Foundation

The ICE Foundation does **NOT** define, imply, or govern:

- Memory storage models or representations
- Retention, decay, or forgetting strategies
- Knowledge graph schemas or embeddings
- Temporal abstraction or summarization mechanisms
- Historical compression or pattern extraction logic
- Learning rules derived from past behavior
- Experiential continuity or subjective state

All such concerns belong **exclusively** to the Consciousness domain.

---

## Constraint Relationship

The relationship is asymmetric:

- The Foundation constrains **validity and attribution**
- Consciousness preserves and reasons over historical traces

Consciousness may summarize or abstract history.
Consciousness may **not** reinterpret axioms or invariants.

If historical reasoning contradicts axioms or invariants,
the reasoning is invalid — not the Foundation.

---

## Boundary Violations

The following constitute **boundary violations**:

- Treating memory or experience as authority
- Allowing historical patterns to redefine axioms
- Encoding learning outcomes as foundational truth
- Using long-term memory to justify invariant violations
- Allowing continuity to override explicit authority

Such violations invalidate ICE compliance.

---

## Canonical Status

This boundary definition is **canonical and authoritative**.

Any Consciousness subsystem claiming ICE compliance
must demonstrate that long-term memory, continuity,
and historical reasoning operate strictly within
the constraints defined here.

The Foundation constrains Consciousness.  
Consciousness never redefines the Foundation.
