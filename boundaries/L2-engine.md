# Boundary L2 — Engine

## Scope
Defines the boundary between **Foundation authority** and the **Engine**.
The Engine executes commands and operational logic, never redefining axioms.

## Foundation Position
- Foundation constrains meaning and validity.
- Engine realizes execution under those constraints.

## Non‑Responsibilities
Foundation does NOT define:
- Execution order or orchestration mechanics
- Performance, scaling, or operational resilience

## Constraint
If Engine behavior conflicts with axioms/invariants, Engine is incorrect; Foundation remains authoritative.
