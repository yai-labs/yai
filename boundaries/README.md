# Boundaries (L0–L3)

This directory defines canonical boundaries by **layer of authority**.

- L0 — Vault (Shared Memory Authority)
- L1 — Kernel
- L2 — Engine
- L3 — API / Orchestrator
- Lx — Documentation (policy boundary)

Legacy boundary documents live in `legacy/` with deprecation stubs at their original names.
