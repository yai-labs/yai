# Boundary L1 — Kernel

## Scope
Defines the boundary between **Foundation authority** and the **Kernel**.
The Kernel enforces invariants; it does not redefine them.

## Foundation Position
- Foundation defines truth conditions and constraints.
- Kernel implements enforcement within those constraints.

## Non‑Responsibilities
Foundation does NOT define:
- Enforcement implementation details
- Scheduling, runtime mechanics, or transport

## Constraint
Any Kernel behavior that violates axioms/invariants is **invalid** by definition.
