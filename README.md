# ICE Runtime
## Execution Substrate of the ICE Ecosystem

ICE Runtime is the **execution substrate** of the ICE ecosystem.

It is responsible for enforcing **how execution happens**,  
**under which constraints**,  
and **with what guarantees**.

ICE Runtime does not define intelligence, intent, or meaning.  
It enforces **valid execution under ICE Foundation constraints**.

---

## Foundation Dependency

This project derives its core assumptions, invariants, and boundaries from  
**ICE Foundation v1.0.0**.

ICE Foundation defines what is valid.  
ICE Runtime enforces that validity at execution time.

Any execution behavior that violates the Foundation
invalidates ICE compliance.

## Role in the ICE Ecosystem

ICE Runtime occupies a **strictly defined position**:

**Foundation → Runtime → Engine → Intelligence → Interfaces**

ICE Runtime:

- does **not** decide *what* to do
- does **not** infer intent
- does **not** redefine authority

It ensures that **whatever is executed**:
- is authorized
- is traceable
- respects invariants
- remains governable over time

## What ICE Runtime Is

ICE Runtime is:

- an **execution substrate**
- a **lifecycle governor**
- an **event and state coordinator**
- an **authority-enforcing runtime**
- the **anchor of inspectable execution**

It exists to make execution:
- explicit
- constrained
- observable
- accountable

---

## What ICE Runtime Is Not

ICE Runtime is **not**:

- an AI system
- an agent framework
- a business logic layer
- an orchestration UI
- a scripting engine
- a policy definition system

Those concerns belong upstream or downstream.

## Core Responsibilities

ICE Runtime is responsible for:

- Enforcing execution lifecycles
- Supervising long-running processes
- Managing sessions and workspaces
- Routing and validating events
- Governing state transitions
- Enforcing authority and capability boundaries
- Preserving traceability and accountability
- Providing execution-level observability

ICE Runtime does **not** infer intent.  
It enforces execution correctness.

---

## Governance and Authority

ICE Runtime operates under strict governance.

- Execution is always authority-bound
- No implicit execution is permitted
- All state transitions must be traceable
- Cognitive invalidation must result in suspension
- Reconfiguration cannot self-authorize execution

Governance rules are inherited from ICE Foundation
and are non-bypassable.
