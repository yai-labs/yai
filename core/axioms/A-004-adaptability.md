# Cognitive Adaptability as a First-Class Property

This document defines the role of **cognitive adaptability** in ICE.

In ICE, adaptability is not a secondary behavior, an optimization strategy,
or an emergent property of intelligence.
Adaptability is a **foundational system capability**.

Any ICE system must be able to explicitly suspend execution
and reorganize its cognitive configuration
when observed reality invalidates its current assumptions.

A system that continues execution under invalid cognitive configurations (cognitive models),
or adapts implicitly without traceable reconfiguration,
is not a valid instance of ICE.

## Definition of Cognitive Adaptability in ICE

In ICE, **cognitive adaptability** is defined as:

- The capability to detect misalignment between expected and observed conditions
- The ability to suspend or constrain execution under invalid assumptions
- The explicit reorganization of cognitive configuration
- The resumption of execution only under renewed authority

Adaptability operates at the **cognitive level**, not at the execution level.

Adaptability does not imply learning.
Adaptability does not imply optimization.
Adaptability does not imply autonomy.

## Adaptability and Execution

Execution is subordinate to cognitive validity.

When the cognitive model supporting execution becomes invalid,
execution must be suspended, constrained, or halted.

There is no valid execution under invalid assumptions.
There is no adaptation without suspension.
There is no resumption without authority.

Execution may not continue by inertia.

---

## Adaptability Versus Error Handling

Cognitive adaptability is not error handling.

- Error handling preserves the existing model.
- Adaptability reorganizes the model itself.

Retries, fallbacks, and recovery mechanisms
do not constitute adaptation in ICE.

Adaptability requires an explicit cognitive transition,
not procedural correction.

---

## Adaptability Versus Learning

Adaptability is not learning.

- Learning modifies knowledge or parameters over time.
- Adaptability reorganizes the current cognitive configuration.

Learning may occur within ICE.
Adaptability governs whether execution may continue at all.

Adaptation precedes any learning process.

## Cognitive Reconfiguration

Cognitive reconfiguration in ICE is:

- An explicit **cognitive configuration transition**
- Inspectable and traceable
- Subject to authority
- Represented by an inspectable **Reconfiguration Record**

Cognitive configuration may include:


- Assumptions
- Constraints
- Priorities
- Goals
- Contextual validity

Implicit or silent reconfiguration is not permitted.

---

## Adaptability and Responsibility

Because adaptability affects execution,
it is inherently tied to responsibility.

Every adaptive transition implies:

- A detected invalidation
- A suspended execution
- An authorized reconfiguration
- An accountable resumption

Adaptation without responsibility is not permitted.

---

## Relationship to Other Axioms

This axiom derives from and reinforces:

- **Execution as a First Principle**  
  Execution must be suspended when its cognitive basis is invalid.

- **Explicit Authority and Inference / Control Separation**  
  No adaptation may authorize execution autonomously.

- **State as a Derived and Inspectable Artifact**  
  Cognitive reconfiguration must be represented as an inspectable artifact (Reconfiguration Record)
  and must not overload “State” as defined in A-003.


Adaptability defines the conditions under which execution remains valid.

---

## Invalid Patterns

The following patterns are explicitly invalid in ICE:

- Continued execution under invalid assumptions
- Implicit or silent adaptation
- Self-modifying behavior without authority
- Retry loops preserving invalid models
- Adaptation treated as optimization or recovery

---

## Canonical Status

This document is canonical.

All ICE components must be able to trace their adaptive behavior
back to this axiom.

Any deviation invalidates the system
as a coherent and governable instance of ICE.
