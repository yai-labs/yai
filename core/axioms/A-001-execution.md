# Execution as a First Principle

This document defines **execution** as a foundational axiom of ICE.

Execution is the primary condition for the existence of an ICE system.
All other concepts — intelligence, inference, planning, control, governance — derive their meaning from execution and are constrained by it.

An ICE system that does not execute is not an ICE system.

## Definition of Execution

In ICE, **execution** is defined as:

> The act of causing state transitions within the system.

Execution is an observable fact.
It produces effects, alters state, and establishes responsibility.

Execution is not a theoretical construct, a simulation, or a potential action.
It is something that *happens*.

---

## Execution Is Not Computation

Computation refers to the transformation of inputs into outputs according to formal rules.

Execution, in ICE:

- may involve computation
- but is not reducible to it

A computation that does not cause state transitions is not execution.
Execution implies consequence.

---

## Execution Is Not Inference

Inference produces propositions, predictions, or intent.
It does not produce action.

In ICE:

- inference may suggest
- execution decides

Inference does not authorize execution.
Execution constrains inference.

Any system in which inference alone is sufficient to cause execution is invalid by definition.

---

## Execution Precedes Intelligence

Intelligence in ICE is not a prerequisite for execution.

Instead:

- execution defines the space in which intelligence may operate
- intelligence is evaluated by how it behaves under execution constraints

Execution exists without intelligence.
Intelligence cannot exist meaningfully without execution.

---

## Execution as an Observable Fact

Execution in ICE must be:

- observable
- inspectable
- accountable

If an action cannot be traced to an execution context, it is considered invalid.

Execution establishes responsibility.
Without execution, responsibility cannot exist.

---

## Canonical Status

This document defines a canonical axiom of ICE.

Any conceptual model or system interpretation that contradicts the principles defined here is incompatible with ICE by definition.

---

## Scope Notes

This document does not define:

- execution mechanisms
- runtime lifecycles
- scheduling models
- orchestration strategies
- enforcement logic

Those are addressed in downstream projects and must remain semantically consistent with this axiom.
