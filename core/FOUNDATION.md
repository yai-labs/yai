# ICE Foundation Dependency

This project **derives all its assumptions** from **ICE Foundation v1.0.0**.

ICE Foundation defines the **axiomatic, invariant, and boundary layer**
that determines whether this project is conceptually valid.

This project exists **under** the Foundation.
It does not reinterpret it, extend it, or negotiate it.

---

## Scope of Derivation

ICE Foundation constrains this project with respect to:

- what may be assumed
- what may be inferred
- what may be executed
- what must never be violated

These constraints are **non-negotiable**.

Any behavior, architecture, or decision that violates the Foundation
is invalid by definition, regardless of intent or implementation.

---

## Referenced Foundation

- Repository: https://github.com/francescomaiomascio/ice-foundation
- Version: **v1.0.0**
- Tag: `v1.0.0-foundation`

All architectural, behavioral, and execution-level decisions
must be evaluated against this exact Foundation version.

---

## Authority of the Foundation

ICE Foundation is **authoritative** with respect to:

- axioms
- structural invariants
- epistemic boundaries
- semantic constraints

No downstream project may override, weaken,
or implicitly bypass Foundation authority.

Deviation from the Foundation invalidates
the conceptual integrity of this project.

---

## Versioning and Change Policy

Foundational assumptions do not drift.

If ICE Foundation evolves:

- this project does **not** automatically inherit changes
- Foundation upgrades are explicit and deliberate
- each version change requires conscious validation

Foundation versions are **chosen**, not absorbed.

---

## Scope Note

This document establishes **conceptual dependency**, not implementation.

Details of runtime behavior, tooling, orchestration, or interfaces
belong to this project and its downstream layers,
but must remain compatible with the referenced Foundation.
