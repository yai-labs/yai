## [Unreleased]
- mind: import L3 Mind plane under /mind as workspace member; add lockfile + Makefile targets; stage yai-mind into build/bin (not in default bundle)


### Added

- Introduced `yai-changelog-check` with PR-mode and tag-mode validation for changelog quality gates.
- Added CI workflow `validate-changelog.yml` to enforce incremental changelog policy on pull requests.

### Changed

- Closed Wave0 strict pin blocker by aligning `yai` + `yai-cli` to `yai-specs@30d04d0`, updating `deps/yai-cli.ref`, and refreshing closure evidence/MP snapshots.
- Hardening wave 1: removed non-core local Python test/cache artifacts from `tools/python/yai_tools` (tracked in yai-infra#17).
- Start infra cutover increment: add reusable `verify` workflow via `yai-infra.1.0-rc1`, migrate governance guide pointer, and add `scripts/yai-govern` compatibility wrapper.
- Release workflow now runs strict changelog validation in tag mode before publishing bundle assets.
- `tools/release/bump_version.sh` no longer injects automatic placeholder entries.
- Added proof-pack governance guardrails (`yai-proof-check`, `validate-proof-pack.yml`, `proof-verify`, `release-guards`, `release-guards-dev`) and synchronized branch helper (`yai-dev-branch-sync`).
- Aligned cross-repo pins for `yai-specs` and `yai-cli` on branch `meta/governance-proof-pack-lock` with canonical proof manifest updates.
- Strengthened docs traceability chain by linking proposal -> ADR -> runbook -> milestone pack with explicit evidence pointers.
- Added canonical agent governance guidance and moved draft TRL audits to a private local folder policy.
- Formalized the GitHub PMO governance model for runbook/MP execution, including cross-repo milestone closure rules and Project v2 operating standards.
