# ICE Foundation — Open Questions

This document tracks **explicitly unresolved questions**
within the ICE Foundation.

These questions represent areas where:

- the conceptual space is understood
- constraints are partially known
- but authoritative decisions are not yet justified

Making these questions explicit prevents accidental assumptions.

---

## Q1 — Long-Term Evolution of Axioms

Under what conditions, if any, can an ICE axiom be revised?

- What constitutes sufficient justification?
- How is backward compatibility evaluated?
- How are downstream systems impacted and validated?

---

## Q2 — Limits of Determinism in Adaptive Systems

How should determinism be interpreted as systems become
increasingly adaptive or self-modifying?

- Where is the acceptable boundary of bounded nondeterminism?
- How is equivalence defined over long time horizons?

---

## Q3 — Traceability at Scale and Over Time

How should traceability be preserved as systems operate
for years or decades?

- When do traces become patterns?
- How is historical compression handled without losing authority?
- What is the minimum traceability required for governance?

---

## Q4 — Consciousness vs Authority Drift

How can long-term memory and historical reasoning
avoid becoming a de facto source of authority?

- How are learned patterns prevented from redefining truth?
- What safeguards prevent memory bias from influencing control?

---

## Q5 — Boundary Pressure from Downstream Domains

How should the Foundation respond when downstream domains
require concepts that appear foundational but are driven by implementation needs?

- When is a new boundary required?
- When should pressure be rejected?

---

## Q6 — Documentation Authority in Practice

How strictly should documentation authority be enforced
across heterogeneous projects and contributors?

- What is the failure mode of incorrect documentation?
- How is correction propagated?

---

## Q7 — Human-in-the-Loop Governance

What role, if any, do human decisions play in governance
once authority and control are formalized?

- Where is human intervention valid?
- Where must it be rejected?

---

## Closing Note

These questions are **deliberately unanswered**.

They mark the edges of current understanding.
Future clarity must be earned, not assumed.

Until resolved, they must not leak into axioms,
invariants, or boundaries.
