# ICE Foundation — Notes

This directory contains **non-authoritative, exploratory material**
related to the ICE Foundation.

Notes are used to capture open questions, unresolved tensions,
and conceptual areas that require further research or validation,
without affecting the authority of axioms, invariants, or boundaries.

---

## Purpose

The Notes directory exists to:

- preserve open lines of inquiry without polluting canonical documents
- make uncertainty explicit rather than implicit
- record conceptual risks, trade-offs, and future considerations
- support long-term evolution of the Foundation without instability

Notes are **not binding**.
They do not define truth, constraints, or requirements.

---

## What Belongs Here

- Open conceptual questions
- Unresolved design tensions
- Hypotheses not yet stabilized
- Areas requiring empirical validation or future research
- Deferred decisions explicitly acknowledged

---

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Axioms or invariants
- Boundary definitions
- Decisions already stabilized
- Implementation plans
- Roadmaps or execution tasks

If something becomes authoritative, it must leave this directory.

---

## Relationship to the Foundation

Notes may:

- inform future axioms or invariants
- motivate new boundaries
- highlight conceptual blind spots

Notes may **never** override or reinterpret stabilized material.

---

## Status

Content in this directory is expected to change.
Its presence signals *intentional incompleteness*, not instability.

Clarity is preferred over closure.
