# ICE Foundation — Research Status

This document defines the **research status model** of the ICE Foundation.

Its purpose is to make explicit **what is stable**, **what is provisional**, and
**what is still under exploration** within the Foundation, without weakening
its conceptual authority.

Research status is about **epistemic maturity**, not implementation readiness.

---

## Purpose

The research status layer exists to:

- distinguish finalized foundations from exploratory work
- prevent unstable ideas from being treated as axioms or invariants
- allow rigorous research without polluting canonical truth
- preserve intellectual honesty about what is settled vs evolving

The Foundation may contain research.
It must never confuse research with truth.

---

## Status Categories

All Foundation content implicitly or explicitly falls into one of the following
epistemic states.

### Stable

Content that is:

- conceptually closed
- internally consistent
- non-contradictory with other Foundation elements
- considered authoritative

Examples:
- finalized axioms
- stabilized structural invariants
- closed boundaries

Stable content may still evolve, but only through explicit, high-impact changes.

---

### Stabilizing

Content that is:

- structurally defined
- under active refinement
- directionally correct but not yet closed
- expected to converge

Examples:
- newly introduced invariants
- boundary definitions being expanded
- terminology under consolidation

Stabilizing content must **not** be treated as fully authoritative by
downstream projects.

---

### Research

Content that is:

- exploratory or speculative
- incomplete or under debate
- not yet validated conceptually
- intentionally provisional

Examples:
- open questions
- alternative models
- future domain hypotheses

Research content has **no authority** over ICE behavior.

---

## What This File Does NOT Do

This document does NOT:

- define a roadmap
- track implementation progress
- indicate delivery timelines
- assign ownership or milestones

Those concerns belong to downstream planning and execution layers.

---

## Relationship to Issues and Projects

- GitHub issues may reference research status explicitly
- Project boards may use status as a coordination signal
- No issue may be marked *Done* if it depends on unresolved research

Research may inform the Foundation.
It may not redefine it.

---

## Governance of Research Status

Changes in research status:

- must be deliberate
- must be traceable
- must not occur implicitly

Promoting content from *Research* to *Stabilizing* or *Stable* is a
**conceptual governance decision**, not a documentation edit.

---

## Final Note

The ICE Foundation is designed to last.

Making uncertainty explicit is not a weakness.
It is a prerequisite for building systems that can be trusted over time.
