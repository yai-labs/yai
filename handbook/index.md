# ICE Documentation

## The Explanatory Surface of the ICE Ecosystem

This site documents **ICE** as a system of systems.

It exists to **explain**, **clarify**, and **make intelligible**
the structure, principles, and behavior of ICE-compliant systems.

It does **not** define authority.  
It does **not** introduce rules.  
It does **not** decide behavior.

---

## What ICE Is

ICE (Integrated Cognitive Environment) is a **system-level framework**
for building **intelligent systems that act over time**.

ICE treats intelligence as something that must be:

- authorized
- traceable
- governable
- reconstructable

ICE is not a product category.  
It is not a tool class.  
It is not an interaction pattern.

ICE is a **system model**.

---

## Core Premise

When systems:

- execute actions
- accumulate state
- adapt over time
- coordinate intelligence

then **authority, governance, and traceability** are not optional features.

ICE starts from this premise.

---

## Role of This Documentation

This documentation:

- explains ICE concepts and terminology
- describes system structure and relationships
- clarifies runtime and execution models
- illustrates how domains interact
- supports understanding and onboarding

This documentation does **not**:

- define axioms
- define invariants
- define boundaries
- override the Foundation

If a conflict exists between documentation and the ICE Foundation,
**the documentation is wrong**.

---

## Epistemic Position

ICE knowledge is layered:

1. **Foundation**  
   Axioms, invariants, and boundaries (authoritative)

2. **Specifications**  
   Formal system descriptions (normative)

3. **Documentation**  
   Explanatory and descriptive material (this site)

This site operates strictly at level **3**.

---

## What You Will Find Here

The documentation is organized around:

- core concepts and vocabulary
- system and runtime architecture
- execution and lifecycle phases
- intelligence and agent roles
- knowledge separation and flow
- governance, observability, and security
- extensibility and protocols

All content is explanatory by design.

---

## What You Will Not Find Here

You will not find:

- implicit authority
- behavioral rules by prose
- execution justified by explanation
- “because the docs say so”

ICE systems are not governed by documentation.

---

## Intended Audience

This documentation is written for:

- system architects
- runtime and engine designers
- researchers and advanced practitioners
- contributors to ICE-aligned systems

It assumes comfort with system-level reasoning.

---

## Canonical Reference

For authoritative definitions, constraints, and validity conditions,
refer to the **ICE Foundation**.

Documentation explains ICE.  
Foundation defines ICE.

---

## Closing Note

ICE does not optimize for convenience.

It optimizes for **coherence over time**.

This documentation exists to make that coherence understandable.
