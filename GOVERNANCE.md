# Governance

Governance in YAI is a structural constraint derived from the Foundation and enforced by the runtime.
It defines how authority, responsibility, and accountability are treated across all layers.

## Authority

All execution must satisfy:
- explicit authority
- traceable authority
- accountable authority

Authority is never inferred or implicit.

## Responsibility and Accountability

Every action must be attributable and reconstructable.
Automation does not remove responsibility.

## Non-Bypassability

Governance constraints cannot be bypassed by implementation details, optimizations, or tooling shortcuts.
Violations invalidate compliance for the project.
