# Project Governance

This document defines how authority, responsibility,
and accountability are enforced within this project,
in accordance with **ICE Foundation v1.0.0**.

Governance in ICE is not a process.
It is not a workflow.
It is not a policy layer.

Governance is a **structural constraint**.

---

## Governance Authority

This project derives its governance constraints from:

- ICE Foundation — Invariant **I-003 (Governance)**
- ICE Foundation — Invariant **I-004 (Governable Cognitive Reconfiguration)**

These constraints are **system-wide**, **non-bypassable**, and **non-negotiable**.

Local decisions do not override governance.
Implementation does not redefine governance.

---

## Authority

All execution within this project must satisfy the following:

- authority is **explicit**
- authority is **traceable**
- authority is **accountable**

Authority is never:

- inferred
- implicit
- emergent
- retroactive

Execution without authority is invalid.

---

## Responsibility and Accountability

For every action performed by this project:

- responsibility must be attributable
- decisions must be reconstructable
- violations must be detectable and consequential

Automation, abstraction, or delegation
do not remove responsibility.

There are no responsibility-free execution paths.

---

## Non-Bypassability

Governance constraints cannot be bypassed by:

- implementation details
- performance optimizations
- local architectural choices
- tooling convenience
- agent autonomy
- adaptive behavior

Any component that violates governance
invalidates ICE compliance for the entire project.

---

## Change and Evolution

As this project evolves:

- governance constraints remain constant
- authority boundaries do not drift
- responsibility persists across change

Adaptation without governance
is a **structural failure**, not a feature.

---

## Scope Note

This document does not define:

- access-control mechanisms
- approval workflows
- organizational roles
- tooling or enforcement strategies

Those concerns belong to implementation layers,
which must comply with the governance constraints defined here.
