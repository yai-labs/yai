# YAI Law Boundaries

This directory is normative.

It defines the canonical authority boundaries for YAI law.
Only L0–L3 (+ Lx) are canonical. Any new boundary must be introduced as a new Lx-level page (or an explicit extension of an existing level), never as ad-hoc “relationship-to-*” files.

---

## Canonical Levels

L0 Vault — physical vault layout and protocol IDs: `boundaries/L0-vault.md`

L1 Kernel — state machine enforcement and trace: `boundaries/L1-kernel.md`

L2 Engine — deterministic execution loop: `boundaries/L2-engine.md`

L3 Mind — intent, routing, orchestration: `boundaries/L3-mind.md`

Lx Docs — doc authority and anti-drift rules: `boundaries/Lx-docs.md`

---

## Legacy Cleanup

The legacy relationship-to-* and foundation-to-* boundaries were removed after L0–L3 became canonical authority.

Do not reintroduce legacy stubs or redirects.
Use only the L0–L3 (+ Lx) pages above.
